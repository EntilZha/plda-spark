biology is a natural science concerned with the study of life and living organisms including their structure function growth evolution distribution and taxonomy modern biology is a vast and eclectic field composed of many branches and subdisciplines however despite the broad scope of biology there are certain general and unifying concepts within it that govern all study and research consolidating it into single coherent fields in general biology recognizes the cell as the basic unit of life genes as the basic unit of heredity and evolution as the engine that propels the synthesis and creation of new species it is also understood today that all organisms survive by consuming and transforming energy and by regulating their internal environment to maintain a stable and vital condition
evolution is the change in the inherited characteristics of biological populations over successive generations evolutionary processes give rise to diversity at every level of biological organisation including species individual organisms and molecules such as DNA and proteins
heredity is the passing of traits to offspring from its parents or ancestor this is the process by which an offspring cell or organism acquires or becomes predisposed to the characteristics of its parent cell or organism through heredity variations exhibited by individuals can accumulate and cause some species to evolve the study of heredity in biology is called genetics which includes the field of epigenetics
two individuals have a genetic relationship if one is the ancestor of the other or if they share a common ancestor in evolutionary theory species which share an evolutionary ancestor are said to be of common descent however this concept of ancestry does not apply to some bacteria and other organisms capable of horizontal gene transfer
in biology an organism is any contiguous living system such as a vertebrate insect plant or bacterium all known types of organism are capable of some degree of response to stimuli reproduction growth and development and self-regulation
the cell from Latin cella meaning small room is the basic structural functional and biological unit of all known living organisms cells are the smallest unit of life that can replicate independently and are often called the building blocks of life the study of cells is called cell biology
in biology a species is one of the basic units of biological classification and a taxonomic rank a species is often defined as the largest group of organisms capable of interbreeding and producing fertile offspring while in many cases this definition is adequate the difficulty of defining species is known as the species problem differing measures are often used such as similarity of DNA morphology or ecological niche
a game is structured playing usually undertaken for enjoyment and sometimes used as an educational tool games are distinct from work which is usually carried out for remuneration and from art which is more often an expression of aesthetic or ideological elements however the distinction is not clear-cut and many games are also considered to be work such as professional players of spectator sports games or art such as jigsaw puzzles or games involving an artistic layout such as Mahjong solitaire or some video games
a video game is an electronic game that involves human interaction with a user interface to generate visual feedback on a video device the word video in video game traditionally referred to a raster display device but it now implies any type of display device that can produce two or three dimensional images the electronic systems used to play video games are known as platforms examples of these are personal computers and video game consoles these platforms range from large mainframe computers to small handheld devices specialized video games such as arcade games while previously common have gradually declined in use video games have gone on to become an art form and industry
a video game console is a device that outputs a video signal to display a video game the term video game console is used to distinguish a machine designed for consumers to use for playing video games on a separate television in contrast to arcade machines handheld game consoles or home computers
patience or solitaire in the US is a genre of tabletop games consisting of card games that can be played by a single player patience games can also be played in a multiplayer fashion in the US the term solitaire is often used specifically to refer to solitaire with cards while in other countries solitaire specifically refers to peg solitaire both solitaire and patience are sometimes used to refer specifically to the klondike form of patience
a board game is a game that involves counters or pieces moved or placed on a pre-marked surface or board according to a set of rules games can be based on pure strategy chance rolling dice or a mixture of the two and usually have a goal that a player aims to achieve early board games represented a battle between two armies and most modern board games are still based on defeating opposing players in terms of counters winning position or accrual of points often expressed as in game currency
astronomy is a natural science which is the study of celestial objects such as stars galaxies planets moons and nebulae the physics chemistry and evolution of such objects and phenomena that originate outside the atmosphere of earth including supernovae explosions gamma ray bursts and cosmic microwave background radiation a related but distinct subject cosmology is concerned with studying the universe as a whole
natural sciences are the empirical sciences endeavoring to explain or predict nature phenomena other empirical sciences cognitive sciences like artificial intelligence behavioral sciences like psychology and social sciences like economics more directly focus on human and in similitude robotic functions and experiences there are five branches of natural science astronomy biology chemistry the earth sciences and physics each domain collaborates experimental observational and theoretical mathematical divisions
astronomy objects or celestial objects are naturally occurring physical entities associations or structures that current science has demonstrated to exist in the observable universe the term astronomy object is sometimes used interchangeably with astronomy body typically an astronomy celestial body refers to a single cohesive structure that is bound together by gravity and sometimes by electromagnetism examples include the asteroids moons planets and the stars astronomy objects are gravitationally bound structures that are associated with a position in space but may consist of multiple independent astronomical bodies or objects these objects range from single planets to star clusters nebulae or entire galaxies a comet may be described as a body in reference to the frozen nucleus of ice and dust or as an object when describing the nucleus with its diffuse coma and tail
a star is a massive luminous sphere of plasma held together by its own gravity the nearest star to earth is the sun which is the source of most of the planet energy some other stars are visible from earth during the night appearing as a multitude of fixed luminous points due to their immense distance historically the most prominent stars were grouped into constellations and asterisms and the brightest stars gained proper names extensive catalogues of stars have been assembled by astronomy which provide standardized star designations
gamma-ray bursts GRB are flashes of gamma rays associated with extremely energetic explosions that have been observed in distant galaxies they are the brightest electromagnetic events known to occur in the universe bursts can last from ten milliseconds to several minutes the initial burst is usually followed by a longerlived afterglow emitted at longer wavelengths X-ray ultraviolet optical infrared microwave and radio
the universe is all of spacetime and everything that exists therein including all planets stars galaxies the contents of intergalactic space the smallest subatomic particles and all matter and energy similar terms include the cosmos the world reality and nature
a bicycle often called a bicycle is a human powered pedal driven single track vehicle having two wheels attached to a frame one behind the other a bicycle rider is called a cyclist or bicyclist
bicycle were introduced in the 19th century in Europe and as of 2003 number more than a billion worldwide twice as many as automobiles they are the principal means of transportation in many regions they also provide a popular form of recreation and have been adapted for use as children toys general fitness military and police applications courier services and bicycle racing
